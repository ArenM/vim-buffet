# VimWorkspace - Manage your buffers and tabs with ease

If you are an experienced Vim user, you might got tired of `bn/bp/ls/Ctrl-^`. If
you are a new to the Vim world, then welcome, and start by learning Vim's
notions of [buffers, windows](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html)
and [tabpages](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/tabpage.html).

VimWorkspace brings the IDE-like tabs into Vim, for easy navigation, and a nice,
customizable look.
